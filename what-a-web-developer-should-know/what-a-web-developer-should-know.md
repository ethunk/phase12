As Web Developers, we are constantly learning. A new JavaScript framework pops up every week. The way we style our applications has evolved from manipulating HTML attributes, to Cascading Style Sheets, to utilizing the Sass CSS extension language. The landscape of languages and frameworks is always in flux.

At Launch Academy, we strive to teach you the fundamentals and best practices of Web Development. Having a solid foundation of knowledge on which to build your career, is what we consider paramount. To that end, we focus on teaching the underlying concepts of Web Development: HTTP, Databases, Object-Oriented Programming, and Testing. In a field that is constantly changing, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of concepts and technologies that stay the same, so that we can fully grok that shiny new language or framework.

The following questions should serve as a guide for what a web developer should know or seek to learn throughout their career. Some of these questions have straightforward answers, while others are more subjective. Many of the questions are conceptual, and their significance might not be apparent until you've gained more experience.

Use this list as a reference point for what areas you might need to work on during your time at Launch Academy and into your career as a Web Developer.
